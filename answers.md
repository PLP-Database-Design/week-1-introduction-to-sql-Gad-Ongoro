### 1. State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)
```bash
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that manages and organizes data. It has several key components:

- Database Engine*: Handles data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
- Database Schema: Defines the structure of the database ( tables, columns, relationships ).
- Query Processor: Executes and optimizes queries.
- Transaction Management: Ensures reliable, consistent transactions with ACID properties.
- Data Dictionary: Stores metadata ( information about the data structure ).
- Storage Management: Manages physical storage and efficient data retrieval.
- Security and Authorization: Controls user access and data protection.
- Backup and Recovery: Ensures data can be recovered in case of failure.
- Interface and APIs: Allows users and applications to interact with the database.
```

### 2. What is a relational database? Give 4 examples.
```bash
A relational database is a type of database that stores data in tables with well-defined relationships between them.

Examples include:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Oracle
```

### 3. State and Explain three classifications of SQL?
```bash
SQL can be classified into three main categories:
- DDL (Data Definition Language): Used to create, modify, and delete database structures
- DML (Data Manipulation Language): Used to insert, update, and delete data.
- DQL (Data Query Language): Used to retrieve data from the database
```

### 4. What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?
```bash
A Primary Key is a unique identifier for each row in a table, used to identify and locate a record.
A Foreign Key is a field in a table that references the Primary Key of another table, establishing a relationship between them.
```

### 5. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?
```bash
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the relationships between entities in a database.
```

### 6. What are the advantages of relational databases?
```bash
Advantages of relational databases include:
- Data consistency and integrity
- Scalability and flexibility
- Support for complex queries and relationships
- Easy data retrieval and manipulation
- Robust security and access control
```

### 7. State four types of data type used to store data in tables?
```bash
Types of data types used to store data in tables include:
- Integer
- String
- Date
- Boolean
```

### 8. What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)? 
```bash
A DBMS is a software system that manages the creation, maintenance, and use of databases.
